### Key Features

The ABAP AI tools Cloud library offers advanced features for building intelligent ABAP applications:

- **Multi-Provider LLM API Support:** Integrate with multiple large language model (LLM) APIs, including **OpenAI**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic**. Other providers (e.g., **Mistral**) that implement OpenAI API standards may also work with minor adjustments.
- **Conversation Management:** Maintain and manage multi-turn conversations, with full access to conversation history for advanced chat scenarios.
- **Tool/Function Calling:** Integrate ABAP business logic with LLMs using function/tool calling, allowing AI models to trigger ABAP methods.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhance LLM outputs by incorporating enterprise data, enabling more accurate and relevant answers through RAG workflows.

### Prerequisites

To run the examples using the `yaai_cloud` library, you need:

- **SAP ABAP Cloud:** An **SAP BTP ABAP environment** or **SAP S/4HANA Cloud ABAP environment** (Embedded Steampunk).
- **abapGit:** The `abapGit Repositories Eclipse ADT Plug-In` must be installed.
